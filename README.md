# Point Comparison Program

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple `Point` struct in C++ that allows for basic point manipulation and comparison in a 2D coordinate space. The program compares instances of `Point` objects for equality and displays them using overloaded operators. This is useful for testing basic operator overloading in C++ and provides a foundation for geometric or mathematical applications involving points.

## Objectives
- **Learn Operator Overloading**: Understand how to implement and use custom operators in C++ by overloading the equality (`==`) and output stream (`<<`) operators for the `Point` struct.
- **Practice Struct Definition**: Define and use a `Point` struct with basic data members (`x` and `y`) representing coordinates in a 2D space.
- **Implement Object Comparison**: Develop skills in comparing objects based on their data, which is particularly useful for future applications in geometry, computer graphics, and physics simulations.
- **Console Output Formatting**: Implement a custom output format for `Point` objects to make console outputs clear and readable.

## Features
- **Point Comparison**: Determines if two `Point` instances are equal based on their `x` and `y` values.
- **Operator Overloading**:
  - `operator==` to compare two points.
  - `operator<<` to print the `Point` object in a human-readable format.
  
## Project Structure

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function, where multiple `Point` objects are created and compared for equality.
- `Point.hpp`: Defines the `Point` struct with the overloaded operators and declares the `operator==` and `operator<<` functions.
- `Point.cpp`: (If separate) Implements the overloaded operators for `Point`.

## Usage
The program compares two `Point` instances and prints out the results of the comparisons.
